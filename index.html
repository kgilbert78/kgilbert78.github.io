                                    I am a recent graduate of Hack Upstate’s <a href="https://careersincode.org/" target="_blank">Careers in Code</a>, where I learned full stack web development. Coding became a passion over the course of this intensive 6 month program. After years of saving the things I’m most enthusiastic about for my spare time, I am so excited to begin my new career and put my passion for coding to work!
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I like to understand things in depth, and I am a self motivated learner who will dig until I find solutions to a problem. I often view things from a different perspective than others. This has been an advantage in problem solving throughout my career as an office manager and in every job I have held. In coding I have noticed that I often see relationships or consequences that others don’t see. As a result I am able to anticipate a bug or see a more functional layout. I am also able to keep the end user’s point of view in mind.  I truly value the opportunity to ask questions in order to find the most appropriate solution. My favorite part of coding has been connecting with people over challenging problems and ways to solve them. I’ve never met a more welcoming, supportive, generous group of people than the tech community of Central NY. I feel so lucky to be a part of it.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I have an instinctive ability and proficiency in languages. My lifelong passion for language led me to a Linguistics degree. I am fascinated by word origins, the structure and function of language, the relationships between language, culture and history. I have studied French and German, and dabbled in a number of other languages. I continue to indulge these interests in my reading, and with the wealth of international movies and television shows now available online I am often drawn to apply my linguistic skills to decoding languages I don’t understand when watching. My long-term goal is a career that combines my background in linguistics with coding knowledge.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I am also proud to be a part of ensuring the future health of Cazenovia Lake, having served the Cazenovia Lake Association in a professional capacity since 2008 and as a board member since March 2021. I am looking forward to using my new coding skills to play a broader role in the future of the Association’s work.

                            This is a work in progress. I chose this idea because it's language related and will give me the chance to try out a Natural Language Processing library to check if the user's input matches the requested part of speech. I haven't gotten to that part yet, but I've been enjoying building the basic functionality! Additional features I may eventually add include MadLibs in different languages, and the ability to convert any short passage of text into a MadLib.
